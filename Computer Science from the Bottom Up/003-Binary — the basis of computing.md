Translating these numbers to something useful to humans is what makes a computer so useful. 

 

Thus given a long string of such numbers, formatted correctly, the video hardware in your computer can convert those numbers to electrical signals to turn on and off individual pixels and hence display an image.

 

**16, 32 and 64 bit computers**

Modern architectures are at least *32 bit* computers. This means they work with 4 bytes at a time when processing and reading or writing to memory.

 

We refer to 4 bytes as a *word*; this is analogous to language where letters (bits) make up words in a sentence, except in computing every word has the same size! 

 

**How computers use boolean operations**

Electronically, the boolean operations are implemented in *gates* made by *transistors*. This is why you might have heard about transistor counts and things like Moore's Law.
